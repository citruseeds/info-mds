# Chix
## Overview
use currency to hatch chick eggs; type you get is random(?); or not, but certain chicks might have "prereqs" of other chicks being present on the grid (climbing the chick tech tree)

each chick has its own special effect/role

chicks are placed on grid spaces; each grid space can hold a certain # of chicks, and a certain # of resources is generated dependent on the chicks on that grid tile

to take a grid, need to wait a certain amount of time (if its empty; time can be shortened w/ certain chicks) or fight the forces on that grid (if its occupied); only grid spaces that are surrounding your spaces can be taken (certain chicks can fly out and take unclaimed land in the distance)

in the case of a fight, if you win, you get the chicks on that tile

chicks can be moved around tiles, but only to other tiles theyre connected to (unless assistance from certain chick types, flying and etc); does moving chicks take time? probably

certain grid tiles may periodically get special spawns on them. theyre given to you automatically if you own it, or you get it if you claim it; do the unclaimed spawns expire? dunno

only a certain amount of map is generated at a time, ungenerated map is "unknown" and will be generated when a grid is occupied a certain # of tiles within it; players can view the whole map at any time

only real goal is to just occupy as much space as possible
